## Contributing

Feel free to contribute to this project as much as you want. Maybe you can start by buying me a coffee. :heart_eyes:

:children_crossing: If you are new contributing we recommend you to start by playing with the core design file [`toroidal_propeller.scad`](./src/toroidal_propeller.scad).

:memo: When you see something you want to add, modify or refactor first of all, you should **create a new issue** providing as much information as you can. We will appreciate if you can write as an user story (e.g. `AS [a user persona], I WANT [to perform this action] SO THAT [I can accomplish this goal]`.) 

:twisted_rightwards_arrows: Then you should create a fork of the project, clone it to your local, create a new local branch and you will be ready to start making changes. You'll need a recent version of [OpenSCAD.](https://openscad.org/)

:rocket: When you finish making changes go to [pull requests](https://github.com/RaulBejarano/Ultimate-Toroidal-Propeller-Generator/pulls) and create a new one selecting your fork as source. More info on [GitHub Docs: creating a pull request from a fork](https://docs.github.com/es/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork). Please add as much information as you can explaining what have you done, strategies you followed, which issue resolves, etc.

:speech_balloon: Your PR will be commented, reviewed and, we hope, :tada:**approved and merged into main branch**:tada:.

If you want to contribute but you feel lost with all this process please fell free to contact to any of the mantainers, they will help you a lot.
